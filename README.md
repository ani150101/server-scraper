# server-scraper
This scrapes usernames and downloads all pfps. Pefect for people who wish to create accounts with realistic usernames and pfps... Note that this does classify as a selfbot and more so this is a demonstration - selfbots are against tos so using this classifies as violating the tos- completely ud so no one will ever know doe! Putting this into a proper bot might be a bit better but yaknow - for demonstration purposes, people love scraping of big servers...
